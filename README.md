# PRODIGY_DS_04
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is 'twitter.csv' and reddit.csv. The reddit dataset and twitter dataset Contains 37k comments and 163k tweets along with its Sentimental Labelling. All the comments and tweets in the dataset are cleaned and assigned with a Sentimet L Label Using Textblob. These comments and tweets Dataset Can Be used to Build a Sentimental Analysis Machine Learning Model.

**Project Task**
   1. Data Loading and Exploration
   2. Tokenizing, Splitting and Converting all data to tensors
   3. Initializing sequential model using Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM)
   4. Evaluating model

**Tools Used**
   1. Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model implementation.
   2. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
   3. TensorFlow: It is used to develop deep learning models for various tasks, including natural language processing, image recognition, handwriting recognition, etc.
   4. Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
   5. Google Colab: Cloud-based platform for running Python code and Jupyter notebooks.
